CYCLONE SEPARATOR OPERATIONS MANUAL

SECTION 1: NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

1.1 Startup Sequence
Before starting the cyclone separator system:
- Verify all safety systems are operational
- Check inlet gas temperature should be maintained between 850-950°C
- Ensure cyclone inlet draft is within -12 to -20 kPa range
- Confirm material temperature sensors are reading ambient levels

The startup sequence must be followed in exact order:
1. Open bypass damper to 50% position
2. Start induced draft fan at minimum speed
3. Gradually increase inlet gas temperature to 400°C
4. Close bypass damper in 10% increments every 5 minutes
5. Reach normal operating temperature over 30-45 minutes

1.2 Normal Operation Parameters
During normal operation, maintain these parameters:
- Inlet Gas Temperature: 850-950°C (optimal: 900°C)
- Outlet Gas Temperature: 750-850°C
- Cyclone Inlet Draft: -15 ± 3 kPa
- Cyclone Cone Draft: -12 ± 2 kPa  
- Material Temperature: 600-700°C at discharge

Monitor these parameters every 15 minutes during operation.
Record hourly readings in the operations log.

SECTION 2: SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES

2.1 Planned Shutdown
For planned maintenance shutdowns:
1. Reduce inlet gas temperature by 50°C every 10 minutes
2. Open bypass damper gradually as temperature decreases
3. When inlet temperature reaches 400°C, begin material discharge
4. Continue temperature reduction until below 200°C
5. Stop induced draft fan only after complete cooldown

Total shutdown time should be 2-4 hours depending on thermal mass.

2.2 Emergency Shutdown
In case of emergency conditions, activate emergency shutdown:
- High temperature alarm (>1000°C): Immediate bypass activation
- Draft pressure deviation (>±5 kPa from setpoint): Stop gas flow
- Material temperature spike (>750°C): Emergency material discharge

SECTION 3: TROUBLESHOOTING

3.1 Temperature Issues
If inlet temperature drops suddenly:
- Check combustion air flow rate
- Verify fuel supply pressure
- Inspect burner flame condition
- Review upstream equipment status

If outlet temperature is consistently low:
- Check for air leaks in ductwork
- Verify cyclone internal condition
- Inspect material discharge system

3.2 Pressure Problems  
Draft pressure variations often indicate:
- Blockages in gas flow path
- Fan performance issues
- Ductwork structural problems
- Material buildup in cyclone cone

Investigate systematically starting from downstream equipment.

SECTION 4: MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS

4.1 Daily Checks
- Visual inspection of external equipment
- Check temperature and pressure readings
- Verify emergency shutdown systems
- Inspect material discharge area

4.2 Weekly Maintenance
- Lubricate all rotating equipment
- Check belt tensions and alignments  
- Clean temperature and pressure sensors
- Test emergency shutdown sequences

4.3 Monthly Maintenance
- Internal inspection of cyclone separator
- Check refractory lining condition
- Calibrate all instrumentation
- Update maintenance records

Replace worn components immediately to prevent operational disruptions.
